Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Dispute Resolution and Class Waiver: If you choose to visit CannAVIV™, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Colorado. If you have any concern about privacy at CannAVIV™, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will try to not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers. Except where prohibited, by visiting and using CannAVIV™, you agree that: (1) any and all questions, controversies, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by means of arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in Denver, Colorado, and shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action or representative action, and you agree that you shall not seek to aggregate any claims with other individuals; (2) CANNAVIV™’S LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, UNDER ANY WARRANTY, IN NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $1.00 AND SHALL BE FURTHER LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN SUCH AMOUNTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, CANNAVIV™ SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR ATTORNEYS FEES ARISING OUT OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED (EVEN IF YOU OR ANY OF YOUR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), AND TO RECOVER OTHER SUCH RELATED COSTS OF BRINGING A CLAIM, NOR SHALL AN ENTRANT BE ENTITLED TO RESCIND THIS AGREEMENT NOR SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR ANY OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules of the State of Colorado or of any other jurisdiction. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three per party and shall be held within twenty days of the making of a request. Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrators, and for good cause shown. Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of seven hours duration. Time is of the essence for any arbitration under this agreement and arbitration hearings shall take place within ninety (90) days of filing and awards rendered within one hundred twenty (120) days. The Arbitrator shall agree to these limits prior to accepting appointment. The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute. The prevailing party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness. In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above. 15.	Miscellaneous: You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure of the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. The failure of CannAVIV™ to enforce your strict performance of any term of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such term and will not be considered a waiver or limit that party's right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim of cause of action arising from or relating to the use of the Site or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or will be permanently barred. The "Liability Disclaimer" provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of CannAVIV™ Entities as defined herein, and each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce these provisions directly against your on its own behalf. 16.
